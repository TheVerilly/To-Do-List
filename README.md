# react-starter-kit
Very simple starter kit for my react web dev projects with **typescript, styled-components, react-hook-form,
react-router and effector (with immer)**

## Ecosystem

* Using font [Eudoxus Sans](https://stijndv.com/goodies/eudoxus-sans/) connected globally from index.html
* For create new alias, just need to edit **tsconfig.json -> paths** and vite-tsconfig-paths plugin will do the rest
